### Part 1: Checking in (no credit)

1. Are you able to log into `cslab` yet? If not, email me now at prudhome@bc.edu.

2. Have you changed your password yet from the default one assigned by our systems administrator? If not, log into `cslab` and use the `passwd` command to change your password now.


   
### Part 2: Unix practice

Here's a chance for you to practice the new Unix commands we've looked at in class. You'll need to be able to use a command's `man` page to learn about new things these commands can do.

1. Log into `cslab`.
2. Create a directory called `ps2` and move into that directory.
3. Get the file at this location: `https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17489/17489-8.txt`
4. Rename the file to `les_miz_french1.tzt`
5. Get this file at this location: `https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17489.txt.utf-8`
6. Rename the file to `les_miz_french2.tzt`
7. Get this file at this location: `https://www.gutenberg.org/files/135/old/lesms10.txt`
8. Rename the file to `les_miz_english.txt`
9. Using a single command, print out the file format and encoding of the three files.
10. Use a command to inspect the first few pages of each file. Make a mental note of the language and title of each book.

### Q1: What file format and encoding is reported for each of the three file?

### Q2: Do you agree with the file format and encoding that was printed out for each file? Explain your reasoning.

### Q3: Looking at the files, you probably noticed that they are all the same book. One of these files is ASCII, while the others are not? Explain why you think this might be.

11.


# Part 2: Video

Make a video of your terminal carrying out the above activities. Here are some guidelines:

* As before, you will practice a few times, and then once you have it down, you can take a video. 
* Feel free in your video to use "sanity-check" commands (e.g., `ls` and `pwd`) that are not specified in the instructions below.
* It's okay if you make a mistake in your video, but only if it's easy for you to recover from it. For example, if you mistype a file name, it's okay -- just keep going. On the other hand, if you accidentally delete a file, start over.



### Part 3: Show me your text editor skills
