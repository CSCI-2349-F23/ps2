### Part 1: Checking in (no credit)

1. Are you able to log into `cslab` yet? If not, email me ASAP at prudhome@bc.edu.

2. Have you changed your password yet from the default one assigned by our systems administrator? If not, log into `cslab` and use the `passwd` command to change your password ASAP.


   
### Part 2: Unix practice

Here's a chance for you to practice the new Unix commands we've looked at in class. Some guidelines:

* You'll  need to be able to use a command's `man` page to learn about new things these commands can do.
* As before, you will practice a few times, and then once you have it down, you can take a video. 
* Feel free in your video to use "sanity-check" commands (e.g., `ls` and `pwd`) that are not specified in the instructions below.
* It's okay if you make a mistake in your video, but only if it's easy for you to recover from it. For example, if you mistype a file name, it's okay -- just keep going. On the other hand, if you accidentally delete a file, start over.

### Part 3: Show me your text editor skills
